Here’s the revised analysis for a **125cc moped converted to electric** in the Negros Oriental region (Philippines), using kilometers and local electricity rates:

---

### **Assumptions**  
1. **Motor**: 5 kW brushless DC motor (comparable to 125cc engine performance).  
2. **Battery**: 3 kWh lithium-ion (LiFePO₄) pack.  
3. **Energy Consumption**: ~25 Wh/km (adjusted from 40 Wh/mile for metric conversion).  
4. **Electricity Cost**: ₱11.4898/kWh (residential rate in Negros Oriental as of January 2025 ).  
5. **Charging Efficiency**: 85% (standard for AC charging losses).  

---

### **1. Mileage (Range)**  
- **Battery Capacity**: 3,000 Wh (3 kWh).  
- **Energy Consumption**: 25 Wh/km.  
- **Range** = (Battery Capacity × Charging Efficiency) ÷ Energy Consumption  
  = (3,000 Wh × 0.85) ÷ 25 Wh/km ≈ **102 km per charge**.  

*Note*: Real-world range may vary ±15% based on terrain, rider weight, and speed.  

---

### **2. Operating Cost Per Kilometer**  
- **Electricity Cost Per Charge** = (Battery Capacity × Electricity Cost) ÷ Charging Efficiency  
  = (3 kWh × ₱11.4898/kWh) ÷ 0.85 ≈ **₱40.55 per full charge**.  
- **Cost Per Kilometer** = ₱40.55 ÷ 102 km ≈ **₱0.40/km**.  

---

### **Battery Replacement Cost**  
- **Lifespan**: LiFePO₄ batteries last ~2,000 cycles. At 102 km/charge, this equals ~204,000 km.  
- **Replacement Cost**: ~₱15,000 (estimated for a 3 kWh pack).  
- **Added Cost/km**: ₱15,000 ÷ 204,000 km ≈ **₱0.07/km**.  
- **Total Operating Cost (incl. battery)**: ₱0.40/km + ₱0.07/km = **₱0.47/km**.  

---

### **Comparison to Gasoline**  
A typical 125cc gasoline moped in the Philippines:  
- **Fuel Efficiency**: ~40 km/L (average for small engines).  
- **Gasoline Cost**: ~₱60/L (current price estimate).  
- **Cost Per Kilometer**: ₱60 ÷ 40 km = **₱1.50/km**.  

**Savings**: Electric conversion reduces fuel costs by **~69%**.  

---

### **Key Variables**  
- **Local Electricity Rates**: NORECO II’s residential rate is stable at ₱11.4898/kWh .  
- **Regenerative Braking**: Could improve efficiency by 10–15% in urban traffic.  
- **Battery Swapping**: Companies like **Starya Mobility** offer subscription models (e.g., ₱1/km in India) to reduce upfront costs .  

---

### **Summary**  
| Metric                | Electric Conversion | Gasoline (125cc) |  
|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------|  
| **Range**             | ~102 km             | ~150–200 km      |  
| **Fuel Cost/km**      | ₱0.47               | ₱1.50            |  
| **Refuel/Recharge**   | ~4 hours (Level 1)  | 5 minutes        |  

---

### **Local Context**  
- **Conversion Kits**: Companies like **Green Tiger** and **Starya** offer kits for 125cc mopeds, with prices starting at ~₱55,000 (Indian pricing, ~₱37,000 PHP equivalent) .  
- **Government Incentives**: While not explicitly mentioned for Negros Oriental, national EV incentives in the Philippines may apply (e.g., reduced registration fees) .  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Converting a 125cc moped to electric in Negros Oriental costs **~₱0.47/km** (including battery replacement), significantly cheaper than gasoline (~₱1.50/km). While upfront conversion costs are higher (~₱30,000–₱50,000 for parts), long-term savings and environmental benefits make this a viable option for urban commuters. For reference, a 30 km daily commute would cost **₱14.10/day** (electric) vs. **₱45/day** (gasoline).
